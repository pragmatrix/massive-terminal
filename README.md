(WIP) This is a WezTerm based terminal emulator focused on one specific feature:

A set of independent panels that are easy to navigage and persist their _context_. 

Context is defined by
- A custom panel name
- Location
- A set of predefined shell commands

Expect all other features to be rudimentary or missing. Before opening PRs that go beyond bug fixes, please initiate a discussion first.

Even though dependencies are preferred to be platform independent, the author maintains macOS only. If you want to add changes that increase maintenance cost, keep them in a separate fork. I am happy to link to it in this README.
